## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Regular expressions

### What I learned

I learned how to display a modal when the form is submitted successfuly. I also learned how to validate an email using Regular expressions and Javascript.

### Continued development

Going forward, I plan to try different approaches to validating input.

### Useful resources

- [novalidate attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#novalidate) - This helped me prevent the default email validation in order to create my own.
- [Email validation with Js](https://www.mailercheck.com/articles/email-validation-javascript) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to validate an email with only Js and regular expressions. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
